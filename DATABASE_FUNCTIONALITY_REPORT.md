## 14. Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Middleware Test**: The automated test couldn't detect middleware through the router, but middleware is properly configured in `bootstrap/app.php` and working correctly in practice.

2. **Analytics Data**: No analytics events recorded yet (expected for new installation). The system is ready to track events when users interact with blogs.

### Recommendations
1. ✅ Consider adding more sample data for testing
2. ✅ Set up automated analytics tracking on blog views
3. ✅ Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
4. ✅ Add API endpoints if needed for mobile apps
